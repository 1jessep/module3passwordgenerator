# module3passwordgenerator

Hi, my name is Jessep Stynchcomb and this is my Password Generator for the Module 3 Challenge. 

Students were asked to pull from an existing repo with starter code and modify the javascript to create a functioning Password Generator
that allows users to choose from a list of criteria to determine the length and types of characters used to generate desired password.
My comments on the code can be found in the Javascript file. 

Attached is a screenshot of the Password Generator along with a link to the deployed page.
